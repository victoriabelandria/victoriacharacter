	<h1>Here is where she lives</h1>
	<p1>She lives surrounded by conflict, in a really mid third world country village.</p1>
	<h2>The way I decided to create my character was in the middle of a conflicted country. She is 
living an ordinary life in a country that is always in social conflict and economic struggle. My 
sources of inspiration were all the films Iâ€™ve seen through these past months and my own 
background as Venezuelan.</h2>
