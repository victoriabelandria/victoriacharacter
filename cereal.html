<h1>FAVORITE CEREAL</h1>
<p2>This gif was create using photoshop and adobe illustrator</p2>
<h2>I decided to animate a cereal box falling on its side and a milk box running away because it got scared. I chose
those colors because I wanted to represent femininity somehow, so the viewer knew that my character is a girl.</h2>
